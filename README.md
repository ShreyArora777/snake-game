# Snake Game using Python Turtle

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library. It demonstrates the use of basic game logic, user input handling, and graphical updates using the turtle module.

## Features

- Directional movement using arrow keys  
- Self-collision detection and automatic game reset  
- Edge-wrapping gameplay (snake reappears from the opposite side)  
- Random food spawning and snake growth upon eating  
- Minimal interface using turtle graphics

## Requirements

This game requires Python with the following standard libraries:

- `turtle`  
- `random`

> **Note:** Ensure your Python installation includes `tkinter`, which is required by the `turtle` module. If not, reinstall Python and ensure the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option is enabled.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named ` the snake game.py`
2. Open a terminal or Command Prompt in the same directory
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python the snake game.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake

## Possible Enhancements

- Add a scoring system
- Implement increasing difficulty (e.g., speed increments)
- Integrate sound effects using `pygame` or `winsound`
- Create start, pause, and game-over screens
